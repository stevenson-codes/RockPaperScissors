# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project contains a Python implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. The script allows users to play against the computer, making selections for rock, paper, or scissors, and displays the outcome of each round. The code is beginner-friendly and demonstrates basic concepts such as user input, random choice generation, and conditional logic.
