# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project contains a Python implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. The script allows users to play against the computer, making selections for rock, paper, or scissors, and displays the outcome of each round. The code is beginner-friendly and demonstrates basic concepts such as user input, random choice generation, and conditional logic.

## To-Do
- Implement a scoring system to keep track of wins, losses, and ties.
- Add a feature to allow users to play multiple rounds until they choose to exit.
- Enhance the user interface with better prompts and instructions.
- Consider adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Add input storing and better prediction logic to make the game more challenging.
